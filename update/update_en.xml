	    Due to the problem that some users have dock can not drag and drop files to open, the reason has been found, that is, close the UAC user account control, close UAC will default to the system in all programs are administrator mode running, because drag-and-drop files can not be started in administrator mode, you can manually open UAC, in the control panel - user account - change user account control, do not choose never prompt, after opening may restart the system, after the restart should be able to drag and drop files, You can then manually turn off UAC again so that file drag-and-drop is not affected
