    <log>If there is an update when the file file is missing, go to Steam Client - Library List - mydockfinder - right-click menu - Properties - Local File - Verify software file integrity
If the desktop icon is not displayed after enabling pre-stage scheduling, you can right-click on the desktop-view-display desktop icon to enable display desktop icon
	    Due to the problem that some users have dock can not drag and drop files to open, the reason has been found, that is, close the UAC user account control, close UAC will default to the system in all programs are administrator mode running, because drag-and-drop files can not be started in administrator mode, you can manually open UAC, in the control panel - user account - change user account control, do not choose never prompt, after opening may restart the system, after the restart should be able to drag and drop files, You can then manually turn off UAC again so that file drag-and-drop is not affected
Or you can modify the registry HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionPoliciesSystem Right EnableLUA is changed to 1, and the system will be prompted to restart after modification
