	    Additional note
1.The stage manager of this version update is only a very simple function, and it can only be a window can not be displayed at the same time, of course, there will be many unknown problems, because Windows system software windows have many custom functions, so compatibility needs to be tested one by one.
2.The function of hiding other windows is only occlusion, not a system-level hidden window or taking over system rendering, but the latter will use interception to hide the window perfectly, the desktop can not display icons, because now the desktop background and launchpad are the same, just a desktop screenshot window, but the perfect hidden window can really show the desktop.

Stage manager known issues
1.Continuous rapid switching windows will have multiple windows displayed at the same time, and there will also be a problem with the current window in the left pre-2.stage scheduling list, which can be solved by achieving perfect hiding of the window
3.If a window is at the top, even if you switch other windows or display it at the top, it is also a problem of hiding windows as above
4.WIN+D or display desktop scheduling will display abnormalities
